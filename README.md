# generator-fragment

> A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for Xrm.

## Getting Started

- Install Yeoman `npm install -g yo` (one-time global install).
- Install this generator with `npm install -g generator-xrm` (one-time global install).
- From the terminal, navigate to your site's directory (hint: creating a separate UI directory in the project root works pretty well).
- Type `yo fragment`, answer a few questions about your project, and wait.

## Development Plans
- The generator works but is pretty basic at this point.

## Changelog
- 0.1.0
  - First commit. Functional but needs work.
